# Drug similarity analysis for huntington's disease
Project Overview
This project explores the structural similarity analysis of Tetrabenazine, a drug used to manage chorea in Huntington's disease (HD), using the KNIME Analytics Platform. By leveraging 2D fingerprint-based and 3D conformational analysis, the study identifies potential analogs of tetrabenazine from a library of polyQ aggregation inhibitors. These findings aim to assist in discovering alternative treatments with improved safety profiles for HD.

Objectives
2D Analysis: Identify chemical similarities using molecular fingerprints and calculate Tanimoto similarity scores.
3D Analysis: Evaluate spatial similarities through molecular alignment and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) calculations.
Integrated Approach: Combine 2D and 3D analyses for a comprehensive understanding of structural and spatial similarities.
Tools and Methods
Platform: KNIME Analytics Platform
Molecular Structures: 2D and 3D data sourced from PubChem
Analytical Techniques:
2D molecular fingerprint generation and Tanimoto similarity analysis
3D spatial alignment and RMSD calculation
Visualization: Heatmaps for similarity scores and spatial alignment insights
Results and Insights
2D Analysis: Compounds with Tanimoto scores > 0.7 were flagged as highly similar.
3D Analysis: Compounds with RMSD values < 1.0 Ã… indicated strong spatial alignment.
Integrated Findings: A subset of polyQ aggregation inhibitors demonstrated both high 2D similarity and low RMSD values, making them promising candidates for further investigation.
Significance
This project highlights the importance of combining 2D and 3D analysis in drug discovery, offering a robust methodology for identifying safer and more effective treatment alternatives for Huntington's disease. The identified candidates provide a foundation for future experimental validation and potential therapeutic advancements.
